# Progress Tracker Plugin

Track long-running AI agent tasks with feature-based progress tracking, test-driven status updates, and Git integration. An intelligent development orchestrator that guides you through systematic, TDD-driven implementation.

## Overview

The Progress Tracker plugin solves a critical problem in AI-assisted development: **how to maintain progress across multi-session projects** without losing context or skipping testing.

### Core Problems Addressed

1. **Context Window Exhaustion** - Long tasks get compressed, losing progress memory
2. **Testing Skip** - Features marked "done" without verification don't actually work
3. **Session Interruption** - Closing the window means losing your place
4. **No Clear Progress** - Unclear what's done vs. what remains
5. **Skill Invocation Reliability** - Skills described but not executed

### Solutions

- **Feature List Driven** - Goals broken into specific, testable features
- **Test-Driven Status** - Features start `false`, only `true` after passing tests
- **Git as Memory** - Each feature commits, creating a clear history
- **External Persistence** - Progress stored in files, survives session restarts
- **Superpowers Integration** - Professional TDD workflow with enforced quality gates
- **Intelligent Session Recovery** - Auto-detects and guides resumption of interrupted work
- **Rich Progress Feedback** - Clear visual progress indicators and phase transitions
- **Deterministic Model Routing** - Explicitly routes simple/standard/complex work to haiku/sonnet/opus paths
- **Lightweight AI Metrics** - Tracks complexity bucket, selected model, and duration (no token/cost estimation)
- **Technical Debt Unification** - Records debt items in existing bug system via `category=technical_debt`
- **Lightweight Checkpoints** - Auto-saves workflow snapshots to `.claude/checkpoints.json` (no git history pollution)
- **Worktree-Aware Recovery** - Records branch/worktree context so `/prog` and `/prog done` can warn when you resume in the wrong workspace
- **Unified Git Preflight** - `prog git-auto-preflight --json` is the single workspace/Git risk probe used by `git-auto`, `/prog next`, and `/prog-start`

## Dependencies

This plugin integrates with the **Superpowers** skills library for systematic development workflows:

```bash
# Install Superpowers (recommended)
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

**Alternative**: You can still use the legacy **feature-dev** plugin, but Superpowers provides stronger TDD enforcement and code review processes.

```bash
# Legacy option (feature-dev)
claude plugins install feature-dev@claude-plugins-official
```

### Plan Artifacts

- Architecture master plan: `.claude/architecture.md`
- Feature execution plans: `docs/plans/feature-*.md`
- `workflow_state.plan_path` must always reference `docs/plans/*.md`

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start a new project
/prog init Build a TODO app with CRUD operations

# → Creates feature list: database, API, frontend, etc.

# 2. Check status
/prog

# → Shows 0/5 complete

# 3. Start first feature (auto-invokes Superpowers workflow)
/prog next

╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

## Bug Tracking Example

```bash
# Report a bug with quick verification
/prog-fix "Users are logged out after refresh"

# View backlog and pick a bug to fix
/prog-fix

# Resume a specific bug by ID
/prog-fix BUG-001
```

**Bug lifecycle**: pending_investigation → investigating → confirmed → fixing → fixed (or false_positive)

## Integration with Superpowers Skills

The Progress Tracker orchestrates **Superpowers** workflow skills for systematic, TDD-driven implementation:

| Responsibility | Component |
|----------------|-----------|
| Feature breakdown | progress-tracker |
| Progress state | progress-tracker |
| Acceptance testing | progress-tracker |
| Git commits (feature-level) | progress-tracker |
| Design exploration | superpowers:brainstorming |
| Implementation planning | superpowers:writing-plans |
| TDD execution | superpowers:test-driven-development |
| Subagent coordination | superpowers:subagent-driven-development |
| Code review (dual-stage) | superpowers reviewers |

**Key benefits of Superpowers integration**:
- ✅ **Enforced TDD**: Mandatory RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- ✅ **Dual-stage review**: Spec compliance + code quality
- ✅ **Task-level commits**: Clean Git history
- ✅ **Session recovery**: Resume interrupted workflows
- ✅ **Proven patterns**: Battle-tested development processes

**Workflow example**:
```bash
/prog next               # Progress Tracker selects feature
                         # → Assesses complexity
                         # → Invokes superpowers:writing-plans
                         # → Invokes superpowers:subagent-driven-development
                         # → Each task: TDD + review + commit
/prog done               # Progress Tracker runs acceptance tests
                         # → Creates feature commit
                         # → Updates progress.json
```

**Alternative: feature-dev plugin**

The legacy integration with feature-dev is still supported:
- Better for **legacy codebases** (has code-explorer for deep analysis)
- Superpowers is better for **new projects** (stronger process enforcement)

To use feature-dev instead, modify `skills/feature-implement/SKILL.md` to invoke `/feature-dev` as before.

## Progress UI Web Dashboard

The Progress Tracker includes a built-in web interface for visual progress tracking and interactive task management.

### Launching Progress UI

```bash
/prog-ui
```

This command will:
1. Start a local HTTP server (auto-detects ports 3737-3747)
2. Open your default browser to the dashboard
3. Display all progress tracking documents

**Security**: The server only binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and is not accessible from the network.

### Features

**📊 Visual Progress Tracking**
- Real-time display of all progress documents (`.claude/*.md`)
- Six-state checkbox system with intuitive icons:
  - ☐ Pending (todo)
  - 🔄 In Progress (doing)
  - ☑ Done (completed)
  - ➖ Skipped (not needed)
  - ❌ Blocked (waiting)
  - ❓ Unclear (needs clarification)

**✏️ Interactive Editing**
- Click checkboxes to cycle through states
- Right-click for quick status menu
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users:
  - `1-6`: Set specific status
  - `j/k`: Navigate between items
  - `Ctrl+S`: Manual save
  - `?`: Show help

**🔄 Auto-Sync & Conflict Resolution**
- Auto-save after checkbox changes
- Background polling (10-30 seconds)
- Refresh on window focus
- Smart conflict detection with merge UI

**📁 Multi-Document Support**
- Switch between progress files
- Prioritized file listing (progress.md first)
- No duplicate paths

**🔒 Safety & Reliability**
- Write whitelist (only `.claude/*.md` files)
- Path traversal protection
- Revision-based concurrency control
- Origin validation (CORS protection)

### Use Cases

**During Development**
```bash
# Start your feature work
/prog next

# Open Progress UI in another window
/prog-ui

# Track your progress visually while implementing
# Mark tasks as you complete them
```

**Project Review**
```bash
# See overall project status at a glance
/prog-ui

# Review what's done, what's blocked, what's pending
# Update statuses interactively
```

**Team Collaboration**
```bash
# Share your screen with Progress UI open
# Walk through progress with stakeholders
# Update statuses during standup meetings
```

### Technical Details

**Server**:
- Python HTTP server with RESTful API
- Endpoints: `/api/files`, `/api/file`, `/api/checkbox`
- JSON responses with proper content types
- Automatic port detection and fallback

**Frontend**:
- Single-file HTML with inline CSS/JS
- No external dependencies
- Works in all modern browsers
- Responsive design

**Testing**:
- Comprehensive pytest suite
- Path security tests
- Concurrency control tests
- Six-state checkbox parsing tests

## Quick Start

/prog done
```

**That's it!** The plugin will:
- ✅ Break down your goal into features
- ✅ Guide you through TDD implementation
- ✅ Run acceptance tests
- ✅ Create clean Git commits
- ✅ Remember your progress between sessions

## Session Recovery

The plugin automatically detects incomplete work when you open a new session and provides intelligent recovery options.

**SessionStart Hook** checks:
1. Does `.claude/progress.json` exist?
2. Are there uncompleted features?
3. Is there a `current_feature_id` set?
4. What is the `workflow_state.phase`?
5. Does the current session branch/worktree match the last recorded execution context?
6. Are there uncommitted Git changes?

**UserPromptSubmit Hook**:
- Triggers lightweight `auto-checkpoint` every 30 minutes during active feature work
- Writes snapshots (phase/task/branch/worktree) to `.claude/checkpoints.json`
- Never creates git commits

When a mismatch is detected (for example, feature implementation happened in a worktree and you resume in the main checkout), recovery/status output shows a strong warning with the recorded branch/worktree path before recommending next actions.

### Auto-Recovery Scenarios

**Scenario A: Implementation Complete**
```
✅ Implementation appears complete!

All tasks in the plan have been executed and committed.

**Recommended Action**: Run `/prog done` to finalize
```

**Scenario B: Almost Complete (80%+)**
```
⚙️ Almost complete: 4/5 tasks done

Resuming automatically in 3 seconds... (type 'stop' to cancel)
```

**Scenario C: Mid-Implementation**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  📋 Progress Tracker: Unfinished Work Detected        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

**Feature**: Registration API (ID: 2)
**Status**: execution - 2/5 tasks completed
**Plan**: docs/plans/2024-01-24-registration-api.md

### Recovery Options
1️⃣ Resume from Task 3 (Recommended)
2️⃣ Restart Execution
3️⃣ Re-create Plan
4️⃣ Skip Feature
```

### Workflow State Tracking

The plugin tracks detailed workflow state for accurate recovery:

```json
{
  "current_feature_id": 2,
  "workflow_state": {
    "phase": "execution",
    "plan_path": "docs/plans/2024-01-24-registration-api.md",
    "completed_tasks": [1, 2],
    "current_task": 3,
    "total_tasks": 5,
    "next_action": "verify_and_complete"
  }
}
```

**Phase values**:
- `design_complete` - Brainstorming done, ready for planning
- `planning_complete` - Plan created, ready for execution
- `execution` - Currently executing tasks
- `execution_complete` - All tasks done, ready for verification

## Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Test-Driven** | Features only complete after passing tests |
| **Git-Native** | Each feature commits, history is progress |
| **External State** | Progress in files, survives context loss |
| **Clear Separation** | Commands → Skills → Scripts |
| **Professional** | Leverages Superpowers for implementation |
| **Recoverable** | Session resumption with context |
| **Explicit Invocation** | CRITICAL blocks ensure skills actually execute |
| **Rich Feedback** | Progress bars, phase banners, next steps |
| **Convention over Config** | Smart defaults, no configuration needed |

## What's New (v2.0)

### P0 Core Reliability Improvements

1. **Skill Invocation Reliability**
   - `<CRITICAL>` blocks force explicit Skill tool calls
   - No more "describing skills" - skills are actually invoked
   - Complete examples for each skill invocation

2. **Workflow State Persistence**
   - New `set-workflow-state`, `update-workflow-task`, `clear-workflow-state` commands
   - JSON-formatted recovery information from `check` command
   - Smart recovery action recommendations

3. **Enhanced Session Recovery**
   - Auto-recovery for clear cases (execution_complete, 80%+ done)
   - Recovery banner with phase-based options
   - Error handling for missing/corrupted state

4. **User-Friendly Progress Feedback**
   - Feature start banner with complexity assessment
   - Progress bars: `[████░░] 33% - Phase 1/3 done`
   - Phase transition indicators
   - Completion summaries with next steps

5. **Workflow Completion Validation**
   - `/prog done` validates workflow_state before running tests
   - Prevents completion without going through Superpowers workflow
   - Guides recovery if workflow is incomplete
